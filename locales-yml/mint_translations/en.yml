        If you are in the Estate plan or above, you can have sections with
        dynamic fields appear based on the option selected in a dropdown field.
        You can add ticket fields to each section, and associate a section with
        options in the dropdown field. If you run an e-commerce store, for
        example, you can have a section open up with a field called 'Reason'
        when your customer chooses the option 'Replacement'. This way, you can
        better understand why your customer would like to have a replacement
        issued. You can create a maximum of two dynamic sections and use them in
        two custom dropdowns. If you've associated a section with the 'type'
        field already, you'll be able to add just one more section to the ticket
        form.
      title2: Dependent Fields
      tour: Help me understand ticket fields
      info_1: >-
        The ticket form helps capture the data you need from the customer when
        they submit a ticket. You can customize your Ticket Form to include the
        right ticket fields for your business, and let your customers and agents
        fill in the information you need in the format you want. For example, in
        an e-commerce company, getting a customer's order ID in the ticket form
        would be very helpful to the agent solving the ticket.
      title3: Dynamic Fields
      info2: >-
        Dependent Fields give you an easy way to create deeper ticket categories
        and identify the biggest issues that clog your support.  With dependent
        fields you can organize tickets hierarchically  into categories,
        subcategories and item affected.
      title1: Ticket Fields
      info4_v2: >-
        If you are in the estate plan or above, you can have dynamic fields that
        appear based on the option selected in the type field. For every option
        in the type field, you can create a different section. You can then add
        more ticket fields to each section. For example, in an ecommerce
        scenario, when the type is chosen as "Replacement", a section with a
        field called "Reason" can open up that will collect the reason why
        customer needs a replacement for the item.

          Each skill should be assigned to a set of agents as well as mapped to
          tickets matching certain conditions.<br><br>You can assign skills to
          agents based on their expertise or abilities. For example, if you
          support multiple languages, you can create a skill named 'Fluent in
          Spanish' for agents who handle Spanish tickets. To map skills to
          tickets, you can use conditions based on ticket properties like type,
          source, product, or customer properties like requester name, email,
          company. So, tickets that use Spanish as the request language can be
          mapped to the skill 'Fluent in Spanish'.<br><br>If the skill mapped to
          a ticket matches an agent's skill, the ticket will be assigned to the
          agent.

        info3: >-
          Skill rules are used to identify which skill should be associated with
          a ticket, based on ticket or customer properties. For each ticket
          assigned to a group, the first matching skill rule in the Skill List
          will be executed. Admins can reorder the list of skills to have the
          most important rules on top.
        info1: >-
          Skills allow you to easily match tickets to the right agents. You can
          associate distinct skills to each agent and create rules to make sure
          that only tickets matching those skills are assigned to them.

          your twitter handle with the words “not working” or “bug” could be
          converted into tickets and assigned to the “Bug report” group. And you
          can create another rule for tweets containing the words “system down”
          and assign them to your “Dev ops” group. The first rule satisfied will
          be executed. You can also link these tickets to specific products.

          Add Twitter accounts to your helpdesk and manage them along with your
          support tickets. You can convert your incoming tweets (@mentions) and
          direct messages into tickets and assign them automatically to specific
          groups. Click on an account to define ticket rules for converting
          tweets to tickets.
        handle_info1: >-
          If you support multiple products, you can link a different social
          account to each product. You can manage the visibility of each
          account. For example, you can make the tweets mentioning
          @yourproduct_france  visible only to your France support agent group.
          The stream for this account will contain all your @mentions and will
          be shown in your social tab. Your DMs will be converted to tickets,
          and you can assign them to a specific agent group. You can set up a
          ticket threading interval so that multiple DMs from the same person
          within that time interval can be merged into one ticket.

          You can create multiple streams to search for different sets of
          keywords on Twitter. Enter the main keywords you want to look for,
          based on your business and even exclude certain keywords, hashtags and
          handles to narrow your search. For example, you may not want to see
          tweets by your marketers or executives in the custom stream you
          created to monitor support queries coming in through your brand and
          brand acronyms.Each stream can be made visible to one or many agent
          groups. You can also pick the default reply handle for each stream.

          The tweets coming in through these social streams can be filtered
          further using certain keywords and converted to tickets automatically.
          They can even be assigned to groups and products. You can set up more
          than one rule and the first rule that the tweet satisfies will get
          executed. For example, you can convert tweets mentioning “switching
          to” with your competitors names into tickets and escalate them to your
          support team head.
        info2: >-
          Social streams are a set of keywords you can monitor from your
          Freshdesk Support Desk account, other than the accounts you have added. It lets you
          track support questions coming in through tweets that do not even
          mention your brand. If you are just starting out or have a support
          team that doubles up as your marketing team, you can even create a
          stream to monitor your business space and competitors. Click on the
          <b>New Stream</b> button to add a social stream, and customize it for
          your specific needs. For example, you can create a stream called
          "Support" and add your brand acronym and commonly used brand
          misspellings. All these tweets can be seen in your Social tab and you
          can reply to them using any of your integrated twitter accounts.

              MobiHelp is completely configurable. You can select everything -
              from the fields in your feedback form to the way it looks inside
              your app. Information like device name, operating system and app
              version are collected automatically without any effort of the
              user. You can also enable custom data fields and collect crash
              logs and breadcrumb trails.
            info1: >-
              Mobihelp is Freshdesk Support Desk’s mobile SDK which makes it easier for you
              to provide in-app support to your mobile customers.
            info2: >-
              Once you integrate MobiHelp, your users will be able to see a
              dedicated support section within your app. This will include your
              knowledge base, and a ticket form so that they can get in touch
              with you if they need help.

      title: Organizing your community
      para2: >-
        For example, when you have a single support portal for your brand, you
        can create multiple categories for products or teams. This will help you
        drive relevant conversations to all of your top-level sections and as an
        administrator, you will still get to manage everything from one place.
      para4: Learn more about multiple products in Freshdesk Support Desk.
      para3: >-
        If you have multiple product portals configured in your Freshdesk Support Desk
        account, you can choose to have one of your categories linked to that
        product. Once you do, users will be able to see that category, its
        forums and all its topics both on your main portal as well as on the
        product portal.
      para1: >-
        Categories are top level hierarchies that let you broadly classify your
        community and target your discussions to different types of audiences.
    topics:
      helpnote:
        para3: >-
          Additionally, agents in your team can create announcements to get the
          word out about a new release or campaign.
        title: Driving discussions with topics
        para1: >-
          You can let your users start new topics in your community and talk to
          each other about your product on business.
        para4: >-
          Forum topics can also be marked as a sticky when you want them to be
          featured prominently, and they can be locked to prevent more users
          from adding replies.
        para2: >-
          Based on the type of your forum, your topics can be anything including
          ideas, questions or problems and they can be started by both agents
          and customers. Based on your discussions, you’ll be able to get an
          idea of how many people are facing the same kind of issue, who is
          eager to beta test your new features or what part of your product is
          hard to understand.
